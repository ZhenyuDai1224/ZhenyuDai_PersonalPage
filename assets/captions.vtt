00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi, my name is Zhenyu Dai and I am 
here to give a presentation about 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.720
robotic system and sustainable development.
Feel free to pause at any time. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.200
The content of presentation
today is shown here. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm going to start the 
presentation with a question, 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.800
what is robots?
The official explanation is here. In vague terms,  

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.880
something that is programmed, something that 
is able to move by itself and can do tasks. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.720
By International Federation of Robotics, 
robots can be divided into two groups: 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.560
industrial robots
and service robots. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.960
Today we're linking
robotics with SDGs, 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.400
so it is their applications that
we wanted to investigate. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.800
For industrial robots
their applications are shown here. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.400
The table illustrates the applications and their
definitions of the industrial robots 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.720
Service robots are first divided into two groups,
which are consumer robots and professional robots. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.240
And then the application of the
two groups are shown here. 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.680
The two tables illustrate the
applications of consumer robots 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.320
and professional robots
as well as their definitions. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.320
The United Nation published the
sustainable development goals in 2015. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.120
There are 17 goals that hopefully can 
turn Earth into a better planet by 2030. 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.320
Some people might wonder what do 
these SDGs have to do with me? 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.160
Well, first, some of the SDGs deal with problems 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
that could impact people's 
lives, like poverty Etc. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.960
Focusing on that help people to survive.
Second, the SDGs focuses on natural environment, 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.240
making sure our descendants 
live in a healthier planet. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.880
Third, the SDGs set up goals 
for countries to work together, 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.600
they promote cooperation so that 
less conflicts could happen. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.040
Lastly, as an engineer SDGs open up new markets
and opportunities for innovations and technology. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
And these are the 17 SDGs
that we talked about. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.880
Robots really play a crucial 
role in addressing many SDGs. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.800
For example, surgical robots could increase
the chance of survival of a patient in a surgery. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.600
This could help decreasing 
the death rate and therefore 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.440
contribute to SDG 3: good health and well-being.
Rescue robots could help identify  

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.880
and rescue refugees
in extreme weathers  

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.400
like tsunami, typhoon or earthquakes.
This will decrease the death rate in  

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.240
the climate related hazards
and therefore contribute  

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.360
to SDG 13: climate action.
Finally, construction robot could help to build 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.800
high quality infrastructures 
with higher efficiency. 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.000
This contributes to SDG 9: Industry 
Innovation and infrastructure. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.400
Let's focus on one of SDGs: SDG 
8: Decent work and economic growth 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.920
One Challenge from SDG 8 is that the global GDP
has slowed in the speed of increasing. 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.800
Robots could help with with this by monitoring
the machines in the factories 24/7. 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.320
This will then minimize the 
downtime of the factory and enhance 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.680
the productivity and therefore 
boost global economic growth. 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.000
The second challenge is slow, prone-to-error 
traditional manufacturing process 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240
among developing countries in 
which level of automation is low. 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.080
Robots could help with this 
by doing repetitive tasks, 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.960
streamline the operations so that efficiency 
and product quality could increase. 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.320
Manufacturing jobs could be dangerous. 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.480
Robots could do the dangerous 
jobs for human and also 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.040
inspection robots could monitor the facility to
decrease the occurrence of hazardous incidents. 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.120
However, the introduction of robot could 
lead to some ethical considerations 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.840
One example would be job displacement, 
as robots streamline operations, 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.560
the original workers are likely to be unemployed.
It is important to ensure that displaced workers  

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.720
find new employment opportunities.
The introduction of robots is  

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.040
likely to widen the wage gap
between high skilled workers who  

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.000
can manage and maintain robotic systems
and low-skilled workers. Furthermore,  

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.360
as robotic systems
could be expensive,  

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.400
it is likely to widen the gap between
companies of different sizes. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.400
To avoid this, training program must 
be made available to all workers, 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.400
so that all workers get the chance to be familiar 
with the robotic systems. Government should  

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.440
implement policies that encourage accessibility
to technology to all manufacturers,  

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.480
regardless of size.
The use of robots  

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.840
for monitoring and productivity tracking
can lead to invasive surveillance practices. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.520
To minimize the impact, the employers must ensure
transparency and respect workers privacy rights. 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.520
This is the end of the 
presentation, and this is the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.840
reference and declaration.
Thank you so much for your attention.
