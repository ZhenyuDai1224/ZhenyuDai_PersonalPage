00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.840
This video focuses on the performance of  
SLAMTEC RPLidar A2 M12 in the application    

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.560
of autonomous retrieving robot Leo Rover.
Our research focuses on a few questions    

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.400
which are regarding to the range,  
accuracy, angular resolution of the    

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.600
lidar. As well as the relation with Leo Rover.
The working environment for the Leo Rover is a 4.7    

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.360
m by 1.7 m flat space enclosed by whiteboards  
with additional whiteboards as obstacles.  

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.920
Therefore this study focuses on on the  
performance of the liar within range    

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.200
of 6 m and with the white surfaces.
The study hypothesized that RPLidar    

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.840
performs reliably over a range of 0.2 m,  

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.400
but the measurement accuracy decreases  
with increasing distance due to signal    

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.160
loss and beam divergence.
The fixed angular resolution    

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.200
of .225 degrees limits its ability to  
distinguish closely spaced objects.  

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.560
All these may affect Leo Rover's ability  
to navigate the complex environment.  

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.120
First let's talk about the working  
principle of SLAMTEC RPLidar A2 M12.  

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.640
When working, the Lidar rotates at  
10 revolutions per second and take    

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.120
measurements every 0.225 degrees, which  
is 1,600 measurements per revolution.  

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.000
Finally an array of position data  
could be visualized like this.  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.880
In the experiment we have used the  
SLAMTEC RPLidar A2 M12, its USB    

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.440
interface, ROS 2 compatible laptop, boxes as  
constraints to the environment of the Lidar,    

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.120
whiteboards as the obstacles and pre-marked  
positions using tape measures, each 1 m apart.  

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.480
This shows the methodology of the experiment.  
First, minimum detecting distance of the    

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.960
Lidar is tested by moving the obstacle  
towards the Lidar while it is recording.  

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.720
Then the whiteboard is moved  
and held for 10 seconds at  

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.360
1 m, 2 m, 3 m Etc. up to 6 m. However it is  
noticed that the data for distance over 3 m    

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.720
becomes extremely noisy. The potential reason  
for this could be the Lidar detecting unwanted    

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.920
obstacles due to insufficient constraints.
To resolve this, the orientation of the    

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.120
boxes is changed. As a result the quantity  
of noisy data has significantly decreased.  

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.040
This graph illustrates the Lidar's  
distance reading over time as an    

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.240
obstacle is pushed towards the Lidar. The  
readings constantly decrease until reaching    

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.120
the minimum measurable distance of 0.145 m.
This box chart shows how Lidar absolute error    

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.280
increases with distance. At 1 m errors  
are minimum and consistent, but beyond    

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.080
4 m the errors become larger and more variable,  
highlighting reduced accuracy at longer ranges.  

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.840
The experiment outputs the  
angle_increment of the Lidar,  

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.160
which is the angle between  
measurements, to be 0.00348 radians.    

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.720
This corresponds to 20.9 mm gap at 6 m range.
After visualizing the result we can update the    

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
hypotheses we set previously.
The minimum range is 0.145 m,    

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.800
the measurement accuracy is acceptable. The
0.2-degree angular resolution implies extra    

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.560
care should be taken into object spacing  
below 20 mm . However, overall the performance    

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280
of SLAMTEC RPLidar A2 M12 is sufficient  
for the retrieving tasks for Leo Rover.
